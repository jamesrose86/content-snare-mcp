## Notes

- **`question_number` must be unique** across the entire request (not just within a section). Start at 1 and increment sequentially.
- **Conditional references are by `question_number`**, so a question on Page 2 can reference a question on Page 1.
- **New clients are created automatically** if no client with the given `client_email` exists. In that case, `client_full_name` is required.
- **Draft vs. published:** Requests created as `"draft"` are not visible to the client until you change the status to `"published"`.
- **Rate limits:** The API allows 20 write operations per 10 seconds.
